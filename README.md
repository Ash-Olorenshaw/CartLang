## Welcome to CartLang!
A dumb interpreted language currently created with Python (hopefully will be rewritten in C/Odin in future).

Check out the `docs` directory for getting started with understanding the language!

## Running

Simply clone this repo somewhere then:

```
cd main
```

then:

```
python3 cart.py -h
```

This project also comes with two example CartLang files that you can try and sift through:

`example.cart` and `test.cart`
